## Javatari Configuration and Launch Options

Several parameters are available for customizing the emulator. They can be changed either directly in Javascript if you are hosting the emulator in your own page, or via URL Query Parameters if you are creating links or bookmarks to open the emulator, or just using it in your browser.

All parameters are in the form of properties in the global object `Javatari`. Just set these object properties in Javascript, or use URL Query parameter/value pairs. For example:

```
Javatari.ROM = "files/Game.rom";      is the same as      http://javatari.org?ROM=files/Game.rom
```

**IMPORTANT:** Any parameter setting via Javascript must be done AFTER importing the `javatari.js` file.

## Media Loading

The emulator can be set to automatically load files like ROMs images and Savestate files. Files may be compressed in ZIP or GZIP formats. Available parameters:

| Parameter | Function | Shortcut for URL form
| --- | --- | ---
| `CARTRIDGE_URL`    | URL of ROM image file to load                  | `ROM`, `CART`
| `CARTRIDGE_FORMAT` | Force a specific ROM Format                    | `FORMAT`
| `STATE_URL`        | URL of SaveState file to load                  | `STATE`, `SAVESTATE`
| `AUTODETECT_URL`   | URL of file to load with media auto-detection  | `AUTODETECT`, `AUTO`, `ANY`

### ROM Format (or Mapper Type)
The ROM Format is auto-detected. To force a format, use the `CARTRIDGE_FORMAT` parameter.
You can also put the format specification in the ROM file name, between brackets. Example: `Robotank [FE].rom`

#### Valid Formats
`4K`, `CV`, `E0`, `F0`, `FE`, `E7`, `F4`, `F6`, `F8`, `FA`, `FA2`, `FA2cu`, `EF`, `DPC`, `3F`, `3E`, `X07`, `0840`, `UA`, `SB`, `AR`

## Launch URL Examples

Javatari is great for displaying Atari 2600 games in the web. With a simple URL, you can launch the emulator and automatically load and run anything. You may combine several settings and media loading options in a single link. Here are some examples:

- To load a game in ROM format:
```
http://javatari.org?ROM=http://gamesarchive.org/Pitfall.rom
```
- To load a game in a ZIPped ROM Image and force the ROM Format to `FA2`
